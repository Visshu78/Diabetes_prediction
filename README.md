# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc., using supervised machine learning algorithms.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Early prediction of diabetes can help in timely medical intervention and lifestyle changes. This model helps classify whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical features.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Dataset is already upload here in this repository
- **Features:** Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- **Target:** Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, etc.)

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
4. Model Training:
   - Logistic Regression
5. Accuracy Comparison of Models
6. Final Model Selection

## 📈 Results
- Models compared based on accuracy.
- Best performing model selected for prediction.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/Visshu78/Diabetes_prediction.git`
2. Install required libraries  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` *(optional)*
3. Run the Jupyter notebook  
   `jupyter notebook diabetes.ipynb`

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add GUI using Streamlit or Tkinter
- Save the model and integrate with real-world health data
- Add feature importance visualization
